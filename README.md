# Logistics Data Analysis and Insights

## Overview
This project involves analyzing logistics data to uncover valuable insights and improve business decision-making processes. The analysis includes SQL queries, data cleaning, and visualizations to highlight trends, optimize operations, and enhance customer relationships.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Logistics Company Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aashokaacharya/logistics-company-dataset-for-sql/data). It includes detailed information about customers, employees, shipments, payments, and more.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Dropped unnecessary columns.
   - Standardized date formats and headers.
   - Added primary keys for relational consistency.
   - Imported cleaned data into PGAdmin for analysis.

2. **Analysis and Insights**:
   - Performed SQL queries to answer business-critical questions.
   - Derived actionable insights from data trends.
   - Segmented customers to understand loyalty and spending patterns.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Created charts and graphs for shipment trends, revenue analysis, and customer segmentation.

## Highlights
### Queries and Insights
- **Shipment Analysis**: Identified fashion and luggage as the most frequently shipped items, with significant profit margins.
- **Membership Trends**: Highlighted membership expirations and renewal opportunities.
- **Revenue Patterns**: Analyzed yearly revenues to reveal growth trends and key financial years.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouped customers into categories (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on membership duration.
- **Branch Performance**: Ranked branches by delivery success rates to identify top-performing locations.

### Visualizations
- Visual representations of revenue trends, shipment charges, customer segmentation, and more.

## Key Findings
1. Fashion and luggage dominate shipments with high profit margins.
2. Domestic shipments generate more revenue than international ones.
3. Platinum customers require focused retention efforts.
4. Branches with high delivery success rates can serve as benchmarks for improvement.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For querying and data analysis.
- **PGAdmin**: For database management.
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau, Matplotlib for visual insights.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **SQL Queries**:
   - Find all SQL scripts in the `/sql_scripts` folder.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Detailed project explanation is provided in `Logistics_Data_Analysis_and_Insights.pdf`.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Charts and graphs are included in the documentation.

## Future Work
- Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast shipment demands.
- Expand analysis to include cost optimization strategies.
